Resume Analyzer is a full-stack application that helps candidates align their resumes with job descriptions using LLM-powered analysis.  
It provides three outputs after processing:
1. **Keywords** – Matching keywords between the resume and job description.  
2. **Honest Review** – An unbiased review generated by the LLM.  
3. **Suggested Changes** – Recommendations to improve the resume for better alignment with the JD.
